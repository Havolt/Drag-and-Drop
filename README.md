# Drag-and-Drop

Utilizing the drag and drop api I have created an application which allows the user to move zelda titles around in their order of preference.

The app currently only displays the result when finished but could be hooked up to a backend language and used to create interactive and aesthetically pleasing polls.

The application can be found at the following link:
